          # automatically scans all subdirectories and looks for a config file stating where
          # that subdirectory should be published. If the config file lives in the subdir,
          # the monorepo can be refactored and publishing still works. As things are today,
          # if you relocate a subdirectory within the monorepo, you need to update this
          # yaml for things to continue to work.
