# TypeID TS
### A JavaScript implementation of [TypeIDs](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid) using TypeScript.

TypeIDs are a modern, **type-safe**, globally unique identifier based on the upcoming
UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.

or TypeScript project.
