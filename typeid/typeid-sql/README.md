# TypeID SQL
### A SQL implementation of [TypeID](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid) using PostgresSQL.
![License: Apache 2.0](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jetpack-io/typeid-sql)

TypeIDs are a modern, **type-safe**, globally unique identifier based on the upcoming
UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.
Read more about TypeIDs in their [spec](https://github.com/jetpack-io/typeid).

This particular implementation demonstrates how to use TypeIDs in a postgres database.

## Installation
To use typeids in your Postgres instance, you'll need define all the
appropriate types and functions by running the SQL scripts in this repo.

We recommend copying the SQL scripts into your migrations directory and using the
migration tool of your choice. For example, [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), or
[Liquibase](https://www.liquibase.org/).

Note that this repo is using Supabase as a way to easily start a Postgres instance
for development and testing, but you do **not** need to use Supabase for this
implementation to work â€“ simply use the Postgres instance of your choice.

## Usage
Once you've installed the TypeID types and functions in your Postgres instance,
you can use it as follows.

To define a new type of typeid with a specific prefix use the `typeid_check` function:
```sql
-- Define a `user_id` type, which is a typeid with type prefix "user".
-- Using `user_id` throughout our schema, gives us type safety by guaranteeing
-- that the type prefix is always "user".
CREATE DOMAIN user_id AS typeid CHECK (typeid_check(value, 'user'));
```

You can now use the newly defined type in your tables. The `typeid_generate` function
makes it possible to automatically a new random typeid for each row:

```sql
-- Define a `users` table that uses `user_id` as its primary key.
-- We use the `typeid_generate` function to randomly generate a new typeid of the
-- correct type for each user.
CREATE TABLE users (
    "id" user_id not null default typeid_generate('user'),
    "name" text,
    "email" text
);

-- Now we can insert new uses and have the `id` column automatically generated.
INSERT INTO users ("name", "email") VALUES ('Alice P. Hacker', 'alice@hacker.net');
```

Note that the database internally encodes typeids as a `(prefix, uuid)` tuple. Because
this is different than the standard string representation of typeids in other libraries,
we provide a `typeid_parse` and a `typeid_print` function that can be used to write
queries with the standard string representation of typeids:

```sql
-- Insert a user with a specific typeid that might have been generated elsewhere:
INSERT INTO users ("id", "name", "email")
VALUES (typeid_parse('user_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q'), 'Ben Bitdiddle', 'ben@bitdiddle.com');

-- To retrieve the ids as encoded strings, use the `typeid_print` function:
SELECT typeid_print(id) AS id, "name", "email" FROM users;

-- You can also use `typeid_parse` in a WHERE clause to filter by typeid:
SELECT typeid_print(id) AS id, "name", "email" FROM users
WHERE id = typeid_parse('user_01h455vb4pex5vsknk084sn02q');
```

## Future work (contributions welcome)
- Include examples not just for Postgres, but for other databases like MySQL as well.
- Consider rewriting this library as a postgres extension. It would make it possible to
  use the standard typeid string representation without the need of extra functions.
