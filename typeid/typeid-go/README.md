# TypeID Go
A golang implementation of [TypeIDs](../README.md)

TypeIDs are a modern, **type-safe**, globally unique identifier based on the upcoming
UUIDv7 standard. They provide a ton of nice properties that make them a great choice
as the primary identifiers for your data in a database, APIs, and distributed systems.
Read more about TypeIDs in their [spec](../README.md).

This particular implementation provides a go library for generating and parsing TypeIDs.
